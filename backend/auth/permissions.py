# Three other modules restated this list and two dropped `auditor`. The CSV
# user import checked against the short list and silently rewrote anything
# else to `viewer`, so a file of auditors became viewers with no error -- and
# `viewer` has no `read:audit`, so the accounts made for people who audit
# could not read the audit log. `api/v2/rbac.RESERVED_ROLE_NAMES` dropped it
# too, leaving `auditor` available as the name of a *custom* role beside the
# built-in one.

# management or SSO config), so they're unioned into VALID_RESOURCES below. Keep in sync
# with @require_auth usage — tests/test_apikey_valid_resources.py fails if a new enforced
# scope is added without registering its resource here (or granting it to a role above).

# @require_auth actually enforces (the previous hardcoded list had drifted — it was missing
# csrs/user_certificates/templates/... — and deriving from ROLE_PERMISSIONS alone dropped
# the admin-only users/system/sso resources).
