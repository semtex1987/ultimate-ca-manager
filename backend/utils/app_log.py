"""Application log file: where it is written, and where to read it back.

UCM used to write its application log to ``/var/log/ucm/ucm.log`` on native
installs and to stdout in Docker, with a silent fall back to stderr when that
file could not be opened. Nothing could read the log back: Docker wrote no file
at all, and on a native install the fallback left the lines reachable only
through the journal, which the service user is not a member of ``systemd-journal``
to read. The diagnostic bundle therefore shipped without the log it advertised.

This module resolves one file that is always written and always readable by UCM
itself, and records which one it chose so the bundle and the log viewer read the
same file the logging setup writes.
